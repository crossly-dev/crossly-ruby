# CrosslyBuyer::CreateListingMagicFillResponse

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **filled** | **Object** |  |  |
| **count** | **Float** |  |  |
| **ai_available** | **Boolean** | False when the seller has no AI provider configured — &#x60;count: 0&#x60; then means \&quot;nothing new could be resolved\&quot; rather than \&quot;already complete\&quot;, a distinction the caller (web&#39;s useMagicFill toast) needs but &#x60;count&#x60; alone can&#39;t express. True whenever a provider IS configured, even if the AI call itself failed for some other reason (network, bad key) — that&#39;s a different problem than \&quot;connect a provider.\&quot; |  |

## Example

```ruby
require 'crossly_buyer'

instance = CrosslyBuyer::CreateListingMagicFillResponse.new(
  filled: null,
  count: null,
  ai_available: null
)
```
